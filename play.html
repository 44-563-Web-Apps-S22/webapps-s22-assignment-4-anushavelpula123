    </h5>

    <p class="speech">
      Yes; I will bring you an answer as soon as I can. I will press, insist, do
      all that should be done. How many things a lover has to say when one would
      suffice; and how impatient he is for all that he desires! Never....

      Clitandre has chosen me to be his interpreter to you; he has fallen in
      love with Henriette.

    <h5 class="ARM">PHI.</h5>
    <p class="speech">What! with my daughter?</p>
    <p class="direction"> (_Turning towards_ MARTINE.) </p>

    <h6 class="ARM">PHI.</h6>
    <p class="speech">
      Yes. Clitandre is delighted with her, and you never saw a lover so
      smitten!

    <h5 class="BEL">BEL.</h5>
    <p class="speech">
      (_to_ ARISTE). No, no;
      <span style="color: orangered">you are mistaken</span>. You do not know
      the story, and the thing is not as you imagine.

    <h6 class="ARM">PHI.</h6>
    <p class="speech">
      It grows upon her every day. But let us resume the subject that brings me
      here. Clitandre asks you to give him Henriette in marriage. Tell me what
      answer we can make to his love.

    <p class="speech">
      Do you ask it? I consent to it with all my heart; and I consider his
      alliance a great honour.
