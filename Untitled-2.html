    <h4>ACT IV.</h4>

    <h5>
      SCENE I.
      <span style="color: rgb(230, 210, 122); font-family: Courier"
        >--PHILAMINTE, ARMANDE.</span
      >

      <h5>ARM .</h5>
        <p style="font-family: Courier">Yes, there was no hesitation in her; she made a display of her
        obedience, and her heart scarcely took time to hear the order. She
        seemed less to obey the will of her father than affect to set at
        defiance the will of her mother.</p>

     <h5>PHI .</h5>
        <p style="font-family: Courier">I will soon show her to which of us two the laws of reason
            subject her wishes, and who ought to govern, mother or father, mind or
            body, form or matter.</p>
        
     <h5>ARM .</h5>
         <p style="font-family: Courier">At least, they owed you the compliment of consulting you; and
                that little gentleman who resolves to become your son-in-law, in spite
                of yourself, behaves himself strangely.</p>

    <h5>PHI .</h5>
        <p style="font-family: Courier">He has not yet reached the goal of his desires. I thought him
                well made, and approved of your love; but his manners were always
                unpleasant to me. He knows that I write a little, thank heaven, and
                yet he has never desired me to read anything to him.</p>
     </h5>

    <h5>SCENE II;<span style="color: darkseagreen">ARMANDE, PHILAMINTE, CLITANDRE (_entering softly and
        listening unseen_).</span></h5>

    <h5>ARM .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">If I were you, I would not allow him to become Henriette's
        husband. It would be wrong to impute to me the least thought of
        speaking like an interested person in this matter, and false to think
        that the base trick he is playing me secretly vexes me. By the help of
        philosophy, my soul is fortified against such trials; by it we can
        rise above everything. But to see him treat you so, provokes me beyond
        all endurance. Honour requires you to resist his wishes, and he is not
        a man in whom you could find pleasure. In our talks together I never
        could see that he had in his heart any respect for you.</p>

    <h5>PHI .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">Poor idiot!</p>

    <h5>ARM .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">In spite of all the reports of your glory, he was always cold in
        praising you.</p>

    <h5>PHI .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> The churl!</p>

    <h5>ARM .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> And twenty times have I read to him some of your new productions,
        without his ever thinking them fine.</p>

        <h5>PHI .</h5>
        <p style="font-family: Courier"> The impertinent fellow!</p>

        <h5>ARM .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">  We were often at variance about it, and you could hardly believe
        what foolish things....</p>


    <h5>CLI (_to_ ARMANDE).</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">  Ah! gently, pray. A little charity, or at
        least a little truthfulness. What harm have I done to you? and of what
        am I guilty that you should thus arm all your eloquence against me to
        destroy me, and that you should take so much trouble to render me
        odious to those whose assistance I need? Tell me why this great
        indignation? (_To_ PHILAMINTE) I am willing to make you, Madam,
        an impartial judge between us.</p>

    <h5>ARM .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> If I felt this great wrath with which you accuse me, I could find
            enough to authorise it. You deserve it but too well. A first love has
            such sacred claims over our hearts, that it would be better to lose
            fortune and renounce life than to love a second time. Nothing can be
            compared to the crime of changing one's vows, and every faithless
            heart is a monster of immorality.</p>

    <h5>CLI .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> Do you call that infidelity, Madam, which the haughtiness of your
        mind has forced upon me? I have done nothing but obey the commands it
        imposed upon me; and if I offend you, you are the primary cause of the
        offence. At first your charms took entire possession of my heart. For
        two years I loved you with devoted love; there was no assiduous care,
        duty, respect, service, which I did not offer you. But all my
        attentions, all my cares, had no power over you. I found you opposed
        to my dearest wishes; and what you refused I offered to another.
        Consider then, if the fault is mine or yours. Does my heart run after
        change, or do you force me to it? Do I leave you, or do you not rather
        turn me away?</p>


        <h5>CLI .</h5>
        <p style="font-family: Courier">  Unfortunately, Madam, I feel, if you will forgive my saying so,
            that I have a body as well as a soul; and that I am too much attached
            to that body for me totally to forget it. I do not understand this
            separation. Heaven has denied me such philosophy, and my body and soul
            go together. There is nothing so beautiful, as you well say, as that
            purified love which is directed only to the heart, those unions of the
            soul and those tender thoughts so free from the commerce of sense. But
            such love is too refined for me. I am, as you observe, a little gross
            and material. I love with all my being; and, in the love that is given
            to me, I wish to include the whole person. This is not a subject for
            lofty self-denial; and, without wishing to wrong your noble
            sentiments, I see that in the world my method has a certain vogue;
            that marriage is somewhat the fashion, and passes for a tie honourable
            and tender enough to have made me wish to become your husband, without
            giving you cause to be offended at such a thought.</p>


        <h5>ARM .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> Well, well! Sir, since without being convinced by what I say,
        your grosser feelings will be satisfied; since to reduce you to a
        faithful love, you must have carnal ties and material chains, I will,
        if I have my mother's permission, bring my mind to consent to all you
        wish.</p>


    <h5>CLI .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> It is too late; another has accepted before you and if I were to
        return to you, I should basely abuse the place of rest in which I
        sought refuge, and should wound the goodness of her to whom I fled
        when you disdained me.</p>

    <h5>PHI .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> But, Sir, when you thus look forward, do you believe in my
        consent to this other marriage? In the midst of your dreams, let it
        enter your mind that I have another husband ready for her.</p>

    <h5>CLI .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> Ah! Madam, reconsider your choice, I beseech you; and do not
        expose me to such a disgrace. Do not doom me to the unworthy destiny
        of seeing myself the rival of Mr. Trissotin. The love of _beaux
        esprits_ [Footnote: No single word has given me so much trouble to
        translate as this word _esprit_. This time I acknowledge myself
        beaten.], which goes against me in your mind, could not have opposed
        to me a less noble adversary. There are people whom the bad taste of
        the age has reckoned among men of genius; but Mr. Trissotin deceives
        nobody, and everyone does justice to the writings he gives us.
        Everywhere but here he is esteemed at his just value; and what has
        made me wonder above all things is to see you exalt to the sky, stupid
        verses which you would have disowned had you yourself written them.</p>

    <h5>PHI .</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">If you judge of him differently from us, it is that we see him
        with other eyes than you do. </p>

    </h6>
    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">
        I come to announce you great news. We
        have had a narrow escape while we slept. A world passed all along us,
        and fell right across our vortex. [Footnote: _Tourbillon_.
        Compare act iii scene ii. Another reference to Cotin.] If in its way
        it had met with our earth, it would have dashed us to pieces like so
        much glass.
    </p>

    <h5>PHI.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> Let us put off this subject till another season. This gentleman
        would understand nothing of it; he professes to cherish ignorance, and
        above all to hate intellect and knowledge.</p>

    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p>  This is not altogether the fact; allow me, Madam, to explain
        myself. I only hate that kind of intellect and learning which spoils
        people. These are good and beautiful in themselves; but I had rather
        be numbered among the ignorant than to see myself learned like certain
        people.
    </p>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p> For my part I do not believe, whatever opinion may be held to the
        contrary, that knowledge can ever spoil anything.
    </p>


    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p> And I hold that knowledge can make great fools both in words and
        in deeds.
    </p>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p> The paradox is rather strong.
    </p>

    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p>  It would be easy to find proofs; and I believe without being very
        clever, that if reasons should fail, notable examples would not be
        wanting.
    </p>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p> I should not have far to go to find what I want.
    </p>

    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p> As far as I am concerned, I fail to see those notable examples
    </p>


    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p> I see them so well that they almost blind me.
    </p>

    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p> I believed hitherto that it was ignorance which made fools, and
        not knowledge.
    </p>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p> You made a great mistake; and I assure you that a learned fool is
        more of a fool than an ignorant one.
    </p>

    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p> Common sense is against your maxims, since an ignorant man and a
        fool are synonymous.
    </p>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p> If you cling to the strict uses of words, there is a greater
        connection between pedant and fool.
    </p>

    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p> Folly in the one shows itself openly.
    </p>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p> And study adds to nature in the other.
    </p>

    <h5>TRI.</h5>
    <p> Knowledge has always its intrinsic value
    </p>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p>  Knowledge in a pedant becomes impertinence
    </p>

    <h5>SCENE IV.<span style="color: aqua">--TRISSOTIN, PHILAMINTE, CLITANDRE, ARMANDE, JULIAN.</span></h5>

    <h5>JUL.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">The learned gentleman who paid you a visit just now, Madam, and
        whose humble servant I have the honour to be, exhorts you to read this
        letter.</p>

    <h6>PHI.</h6>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">However important this letter may be, learn, friend, that it is a
        piece of rudeness to come and interrupt a conversation, and that a
        servant who knows his place should apply first to the people of the
        household to be introduced.
    </p>

    <h5>PHI.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">
        "_Trissotin boasts, Madam, that he is to marry
        your daughter. I give you notice that his philosophy aims only at your
        wealth, and that you would do well not to conclude this marriage
        before you have seen the poem which I am composing against him. While
        you are waiting for this portrait, in which I intend to paint him in
        all his colours, I send you Horace, Virgil, Terence, and Catullus,
        where you will find marked in the margin all the passages he has
        pilfered._"
        
        We see there merit attacked by many enemies because of the marriage I
        have decided upon. But this general ill-feeling only prompts me to an
        action which will confound envy, and make it feel that whatever it
        does only hastens the end. (_To_ JULIAN) Tell all this to your
        master; tell him also that in order to let him know how much value I
        set on his disinterested advice, and how worthy of being followed I
        esteem it, this very evening I shall marry my daughter to this
        gentleman (_showing_ TRISSOTIN).
    </p>

    <h5>SCENE V.<span style="color: aqua">--PHILAMINTE, ARMANDE, CLITANDRE.</span></h5>
    
    <h5>PHI. (_to_ CLITANDRE).</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> You, Sir, as a friend of the family, may
        assist at the signing of the contract, for I am willing to invite you
        to it. Armande, be sure you send for the notary, and tell your sister
        of my decision.
    </p>

    <h5>ARM.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> There is no need of saying anything to my sister; this gentleman
        will be pretty sure to take the news to her, and try and dispose her
        heart to rebellion.
    </p>

    <h5>PHI.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> We shall see who has most power over her, and whether I can bring
        her to a sense of her duty.
    </p>


    <h5>SCENE VI.<span style="color: aqua">.--ARMANDE, CLITANDRE.</span></h5>

    <h5>ARM.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> I am very sorry to see, Sir, that things are not going quite
        according to your views.
    </p>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> I shall go and do all I can not to leave this serious anxiety
        upon your mind.
    </p>



    <h5>SCENE VII.<span style="color: aqua">--CHRYSALE, ARISTE, HENRIETTE, CLITANDRE.</span></h5>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> I should be most unfortunate without your assistance, Sir, for
        your wife has rejected my offer, and, her mind being prepossessed in
        favour of Trissotin, she insists upon having him for a son-in-law.
    </p>

    <h5>CHRY.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> But what fancy is this that she has got into her head? Why in
        the world will she have this Mr. Trissotin?
    </p>

    <h5>SCENE VIII.<span style="color: aqua">--HENRIETTE, CLITANDRE..</span></h5>

    <h5>CLI.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier"> However great may be the help that is promised to my love, my
        greatest hope is in your constancy.
    </p>

    <h5>HEN.</h5>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">  I will try everything for the furtherance of our dearest wishes,
        and if after all I cannot be yours, there is a sure retreat I have
        resolved upon, which will save me from belonging to any one else.
